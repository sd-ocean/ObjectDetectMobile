How to download chosen model at runtime(Hai's note)

Option A: Firebase ML -> best
	Host each .tflite as a "custom model" in Firebase
	Download after the user picks “Indoor” or “Outdoor.”

Practical implementation
	UX: show one time choose model indoor or outdoor screen -> download, grey out the feature until it's ready
	Background download & progress: Use WorkManager (foreground worker) for robust, cancellable downloads and user-visible progress if you self-host models.
	Where to store files?
	Cleanup: ability for user to delete this
	Space constraints
